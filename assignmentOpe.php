<!-- In PHP, an assignment operator is used to assign values to variables, with the basic form being:
$a = 10; — assigns the value 10 to the variable $a.

Common assignment operators in PHP:
$a = $b → Assigns value of $b to $a

$a += $b → $a = $a + $b

$a -= $b → $a = $a - $b

$a *= $b → $a = $a * $b

$a /= $b → $a = $a / $b

$a %= $b → $a = $a % $b

$a .= $b → Concatenates $b to $a -->


<!-- SImple assign operator -->
<?php
$y =75;
echo $y, "\n";


//Add then assign operator
$y = 100;
$y+= 200;
echo $y,"\n";
?>
